# Freedom22
REDEFINING THE $3 TRILLION NONPROFIT SECTOR THROUGH THE POWER OF DECENTRALIZATION.  GIVE TO CHARITIES OR GOOD CAUSES? WONDER WHAT THE FEES ARE, WHO DECIDES WHERE THE MONEY GOES AND WHERE THE MONEY ACTUALLY GOES? (HELLO GOFUNDME )  INTRODUCING FREEDOM DAO.  YOU PAY FEES ON TRANSACTIONS BUT THOSE FUNDS GO TO A TREASURY WHERE YOU HAVE THE POWER TO VOTE ON WHICH CAUSES THE DAO SUPPORTS.  OH AND YOU ALSO GET PAID IN ETH REFLECTIONS JUST FOR HOLDING. DOING GOOD IN THE WORLD AND GETTING PAID FOR IT. SOUNDS GOOD RIGHT?  OVER TIME THE TREASURY WILL NOT SOLELY RELY ON VOLUME TO BUILD THE TREASURY. FUNDS WILL BE INVESTED IN CRYPTO NATIVE SOCIAL ENTERPRISES.  OUR GOOD CAUSE, SUPPORTING OTHER GOOD CAUSES, GENERATING MORE PROFIT TO SUPPORT MORE GOOD CAUSES!
